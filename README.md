This repository contains coding exercises and projects completed as part of the "Web Developer Bootcamp 2024" Udemy course. I began working on this course in July 2024, and the repository is continually updated with new projects and exercises as I progress through the material. The course covers comprehensive full-stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

Each project demonstrates key concepts learned in the course, from front-end development to back-end programming. As I continue to expand my skills and knowledge, I will keep adding new projects and improvements to this repository
