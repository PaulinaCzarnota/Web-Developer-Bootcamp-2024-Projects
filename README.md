This repository contains coding exercises and projects completed as part of the "Web Developer Bootcamp 2024" Udemy course, taught by Colt Steele. I began the course in July and completed it in October 2024. The course provides comprehensive full-stack web development training, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more.

It explores a wide range of topics, including responsive design, React hooks, MaterialUI, state management, RESTful APIs, authentication, security best practices, and deploying applications to the cloud.

Each project in this repository demonstrates key concepts learned, from front-end to back-end development. As I continue to expand my skills and knowledge, I will keep adding new projects and improvements.
